//   - (TOR) Tor Exit Nodes. The Tor Project is an open network used by those
//     who wish to maintain anonymity. Anonymity: High.
//   - (DCH) Hosting Provider, Data Center or Content Delivery Network. Since
//     hosting providers and data centers can serve to provide anonymity, the
//     Anonymous IP database flags IP addresses associated with them. Anonymity:
//     Low.
//   - (PUB) Public Proxies. These are services which make connection requests
//     on a user's behalf. Proxy server software can be configured by the
//     administrator to listen on some specified port. These differ from VPNs in
//     that the proxies usually have limited functions compare to VPNs.
//     Anonymity: High.
//   - (WEB) Web Proxies. These are web services which make web requests on a
//     user's behalf. These differ from VPNs or Public Proxies in that they are
//     simple web-based proxies rather than operating at the IP address and
//     other ports level. Anonymity: High.
//   - (SES) Search Engine Robots. These are services which perform crawling or
//     scraping to a website, such as, the search engine spider or bots engine.
//     Anonymity: Low.
//   - (RES) Residential proxies. These services offer users proxy connections
//     through residential ISP with or without consents of peers to share their
//     idle resources. Only available with PX10 - PX12. Anonymity: Medium.
//   - (CPN) Consumer Privacy Networks. These services ensure encrypted traffic
//     from the user's browser by routing internet requests through relays,
//     concealing the IP address, location, and browsing activity. Only
//     available with PX11 & PX12. Anonymity: Low.
//   - (EPN) Enterprise Private Networks. Services like SASE or SD-WAN combine
//     network security functions with wide-area networking (WAN) capabilities
//     to meet the secure remote access needs of organizations. Only available
//     with PX11 & PX12. Anonymity: Low.
